# Paddle Ball Game 🕹️

A simple paddle-and-ball arcade game built using **Python** and **Pygame**. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen, aiming to keep the ball bouncing and prevent it from falling past the paddle. When the ball is missed, the game resets.

> This project is inspired by classic arcade games like **Breakout** — a single-player variation of Pong that replaces the opponent with a wall of bricks. While my version doesn’t yet include bricks, it follows a similar principle of bouncing and paddle control. As a big fan of old-school arcade games, I really enjoyed recreating this mechanic from scratch!

## 📖 About This Project  
Hi! I'm Kelvin, and this project was one of my early explorations into interactive programming using Python. After discovering a passion for software development, I began building small projects like this to help solidify my understanding of programming logic, physics, and user interaction.

This game was inspired by classic arcade mechanics and built with **Pygame**, a beginner-friendly Python library for creating games and multimedia applications. It helped me understand the structure of a game loop, how to manage screen refresh rates, detect collisions, and handle user input in real time.

## 🎯 Features
- Player-controlled paddle using arrow keys
- Collision detection between paddle and ball
- Ball resets when it falls past the paddle
- Structured game loop with Pygame

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Basics of Pygame's game loop and rendering
- Using keyboard input to control in-game objects
- Implementing simple physics like velocity and reflection
- Structuring code into logical sections
- Debugging using console printouts and iteration

## 🔧 How to Run It Locally
Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Then run the game file:

```bash
python bouncing_ball.py
```

You should see a window with a moving ball and a controllable paddle. Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** to keep the ball from falling!
